# Weather-Application
This is a web application that uses an API known as OpenWeatherMap. 

Note that it might be better to put the Python file into another folder, which should be named "cgi-bin". 

The mp4 file shows how the program works. 

**Important Notes**

Regarding how to run it, please

(0) go to whereever the "weather.py" file is saved by using, for example, "cd Desktop" (note that it is **NOT** "cd Desktop/cgi-bin")

(1) run "python -m http.server --cgi 8000" using your terminal 

(2) open the http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/weather.py link using your browser

:)
