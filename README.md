# Weather-Application
For one of the classes I took when I was in Year 3, I had to make a web application using an API known as OpenWeatherMap. 

Note that it might be better to put the Python file into another folder, which should be named "cgi-bin". 

The mp4 file shows how the program works. 

Regarding how to run it, please

(1) run "python -m http.server --cgi 8000" using your terminal and

(2) open the http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/weather.py link using your browser.
